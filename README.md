# owncloud-documentation

This repository has been created to exemplify the usage of GitHub to store markdown as a code base for documentation. We will be using the [Owncloud](https://owncloud.com/) data storage platform as a subject matter base for documenting select activities associated with the installation and administration of this product.

## Key Topics

Four topics will be discussed in sufficient detail to approximate the following:

* Installation and configuration of an Owncloud server
* Enabling basic connectivity to the service
* Adding user accounts
* Connecting to the Owncloud instance with desktop and mobile clients
